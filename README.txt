WELCOME TO STUDY_TRACKER by Eric Wing

========================================================================================================================
Study_Tracker is a simple productivity tool that allows you to time your study sessions. I created this app for personal use
and have been slowly improving it over time. My goal with this project was to promote better study habits and time management. 
They say for every hour you spend in lecture, you should spend an additional 2 hours studying that subject. During my Freshman year 
in college, I wanted to put this theory to the test and see exactly how much time I spent studying. What started out as a primitive
terminal program that I would tinker with during my CS 1 classes eventually turned into what you see today. It still isn't much, but
it gets the job done.

HOW TO USE STUDY_TRACKER

Download "Study_Tracker.exe" located in the "dist" folder.

A log.json file will be created in the same directory as Study_Tracker.exe. This file contains your saved study log.
Please keep these files in the same directory to avoid losing save data. A fix to this issue is in the works.

Study_Tracker will automatically create a log.json file with a default list of subjects. You can reset this list anytime
in Settings by pressing the "Clear History" button -- BEWARE: this will delete all study log data. 

Subjects can be added or deleted in Settings.

Use the dropdown menu in the Today tab to switch subjects.
Press Start to start the timer. 
Press Stop to stop the timer and save your time to the study log.

Please report any bugs. More features coming soon :)
